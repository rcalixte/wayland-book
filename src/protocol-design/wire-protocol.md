# Wire protocol basics

**Note**: If you're just going to use libwayland, this chapter is optional -
feel free to skip to chapter 2.2.

---

The wire protocol is a stream of 32-bit values, encoded with the host's byte
order (e.g. little-endian on x86 family CPUs). These values represent the
following primitive types:

**int, uint**: 32-bit signed or unsigned integer.

**fixed**: 24.8 bit signed fixed-point numbers.

**object**: 32-bit object ID.

**new_id**: 32-bit object ID which allocates that object when received.

In addition to these primitives, the following other types are used:

**string**: A string, prefixed with a 32-bit integer specifying its length (in
bytes), followed by the string contents and a NULL terminator, padded to 32
bits with undefined data. The encoding is not specified, but in practice UTF-8
is used.

**array**: A blob of arbitrary data, prefixed with a 32-bit integer specifying
its length (in bytes), then the verbatim contents of the array, padded to 32
bits with undefined data.

**fd**: 0-bit value on the primary transport, but transfers a file descriptor to
the other end using the ancillary data in the Unix domain socket message
(msg_control).

**enum**: A single value (or bitmap) from an enumeration of known constants,
encoded into a 32-bit integer.

## Messages

The wire protocol is a stream of messages built with these primitives. Every
message is an event (in the case of server to client messages) or request
(client to server) which acts upon an *object*.

The message header is two words. The first word is the affected object ID. The
second is two 16-bit values; the upper 16 bits are the size of the message
(including the header itself) and the lower 16 bits are the event or request
opcode. The message arguments follow, based on a message signature agreed upon
in advance by both parties. The recipient looks up the object ID's interface and
the event or request defined by its opcode to determine the signature and nature
of the message.

To understand a message, the client and server have to establish the objects in
the first place. Object ID 1 is pre-allocated as the Wayland display singleton,
and can be used to bootstrap other objects. We'll discuss this in chapter 4. The
next chapter goes over what an interface is, and how requests and events work,
assuming you've already negotiated an object ID. Speaking of which...

## Object IDs

When a message comes in with a `new_id` argument, the sender allocates an
object ID for it (the interface used for this object is established through
additional arguments, or agreed upon in advance for that request/event). This
object ID can be used in future messages, either as the first word of the
header, or as an `object_id` argument. The client allocates IDs in the range of
`[1, 0xFEFFFFFF]`, and the server allocates IDs in the range of `[0xFF000000,
0xFFFFFFFF]`. IDs begin at the lower end of this bound and increment with each
new object allocation.

An object ID of 0 represents a `NULL` object; that is, a non-existent object or
the explicit lack of an object.

## Transports

To date all known Wayland implementations work over a Unix domain socket. This
is used for one reason in particular: file descriptor messages. Unix sockets are
the most practical transport capable of transferring file descriptors between
processes, and this is necessary for large data transfers (keymaps, pixel
buffers, and clipboard contents being the main use-cases). In theory, a
different transport (e.g. TCP) is possible, but someone would have to figure out
an alternative way of transferring bulk data.

To find the Unix socket to connect to, most implementations just do what
libwayland does:

1. If `WAYLAND_SOCKET` is set, interpret it as a file descriptor number on which
   the connection is already established, assuming that the parent process
   configured the connection for us.
2. If `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is set, concat with `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` to form the path
   to the Unix socket.
3. Assume the socket name is `wayland-0` and concat with `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` to
   form the path to the Unix socket.
4. Give up.
