## Protocol design patterns

There are some key concepts which have been applied in the design of most
Wayland protocols that we should briefly cover here. These patterns are found
throughout the high-level Wayland protocol and protocol extensions (well, in the
Wayland protocol, at least[^1]). If you find yourself writing your own
protocol extensions, you'd be wise to apply these patterns yourself.

### Atomicity

The most important of the Wayland protocol design patterns is *atomicity*. A
stated goal of Wayland is "every frame is perfect". To this end, most interfaces
allow you to update them transactionally, using several requests to build up a
new representation of its state, then committing them all at once. For example,
there are several properties that may be configured on a `wl_surface`:

- An attached pixel buffer
- A damaged area that needs to be redrawn
- A region defined as opaque, for optimization purposes
- A region where input events are acceptable
- A transformation, like rotating 90 degrees
- A buffer scale, used for HiDPI

The interface includes separate requests for configuring each of these, but
these are applied to a *pending* state. Only when the **commit** request is sent
does the pending state get merged into the *current* state, allowing you to
atomically update all of these properties within a single frame. Combined with a
few other key design decisions, this allows Wayland compositors to render
everything perfectly in every frame &mdash; no tearing or partially updated 
windows, just every pixel in its place and every place in its pixel.

### Resource lifetimes

Another important design pattern is avoiding a situation where the server or
client is sending events or requests that pertain to an invalid object. For this
reason, interfaces which define resources that have finite lifetimes will often
include requests and events through which the client or server can state their
intention to no longer send requests or events for that object. Only once both
sides have agreed to this &mdash; asynchronously &mdash; do they destroy the 
resources they allocated for that object.

Wayland is a fully asynchronous protocol. Messages are guaranteed to arrive in
the order they were sent, but only with respect to one sender. For example, the
server may have several input events queued up when the client decides to
destroy its keyboard device. The client must correctly deal with events for an
object it no longer needs until the server catches up. Likewise, had the client
queued up some requests for an object before destroying it, it would have had to
send these requests in the correct order so that the object is no longer used
after the client agreed it had been destroyed.

### Versioning

There are two versioning models in use in Wayland protocols: unstable and
stable. Both models only allow for backwards-compatible changes, but when a
protocol transitions from unstable to stable, one last breaking change is
permitted. This gives protocols an incubation period during which we can test
them in practice, then apply our insights in one last big set of breaking
changes to make a protocol that should stand the test of time[^2].

To make a backwards-compatible change, you may only add new events or requests
to the end of an interface, or new members to the end of an enum. Additionally,
each implementation must limit itself to using only the messages supported by
the other end of the connection. We'll discuss in chapter 5 how we establish
which versions of each interface are in use by each party.

[^1]: Except for that one interface. Look, at least we tried, right?

[^2]: Note that many useful protocols are still unstable at the time of writing. They may be a little kludgy, but they still see widespread use, which is why backwards compatibility is important. When promoting a protocol from unstable to stable, it's done in a way that allows software to support both the unstable and stable protocols simultaneously, allowing for a smoother transition.
