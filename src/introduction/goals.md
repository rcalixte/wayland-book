## Goals & target audience

Our goal is for you to come away from this book with an understanding of the
Wayland protocol and its high-level usage. You should have a solid understanding
of everything in the core Wayland protocol, as well as the knowledge necessary
to evaluate and implement the various protocol extensions necessary for its
productive use. Primarily, this book uses the concerns of a Wayland client to
frame its presentation of Wayland. However, it should provide some utility for
those working on Wayland compositors as well.

The free desktop ecosystem is complex and built from many discrete parts. We are
going to discuss these pieces very little &mdash; you won't find information 
here about leveraging libdrm in your Wayland compositor, or using libinput to 
process evdev events. Thus, this book is not a comprehensive guide for building 
Wayland compositors. We're also not going to talk about drawing technologies 
which are useful for Wayland clients, such as Cairo, Pango, GTK+, and so on, and 
thus nor is this a robust guide for the practical Wayland client 
implementation. Instead, we focus only on the particulars of Wayland.

This book only covers the protocol and libwayland. If you are writing a client
and are already familiar with your favorite user interface rendering library,
bring your own pixels and we'll help you display them on Wayland. If you already
have an understanding of the technologies required to operate displays and input
devices for your compositor, this book will help you learn how to talk to
clients.
